- Download the latest build and Open `crypterv2.exe`.
- If you want to configure the Application go to this Path because the Settings Ui is still under construction. (We will switch to sql for the settings in later versions)
```
C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\JW_Limited\crypterv2\config.settings
```
- if you want to delete youre history go to the directory where you enzipped the application and delete ```encrypted_operations.db```
and ```playlist.db```
